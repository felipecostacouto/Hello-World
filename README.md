Testes Git
08/08/2020
hey everybody, i am making some tests of git's commands to learn them.
Only practice can make you learn.
Results are more important than certificades.
I know a little bit of Fortran, Python, Java, SQL
My main goals are: learn Back and front end(full stack) , Frameworks, improve my knowledge on Linux, to further use Kali Linux, and do some fun algoritms and softwares
, learn somethings about blockchain,IA,data and security are good for my future self.
Other goals: travel the world, live in the US, be a awesome programmer, have a lot of money to have freedom and enjoy life still young.
read a lot of books as weel and maybe publish my own.
I discovery that i wanted to be a programmer late with 23 years old, i used to study Chemical enginnering back in Brasília, but i manage to move to São Paulo in 2020 to join 
University of São Paulo and now i am studying Information Systems.
Okay, i wrote some stuff about myself, i now it is time to commit, i will probably see this in some years, by the time i will know what i had acomplish, hope most of the things in this list.
Like they say, give me 5-10 years and watch my sucess.
